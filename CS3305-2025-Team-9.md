## 4 Challanges &  Lessons learned
We experienced a wide variety of challenges, largely caused by interacting with new technologies. We have been lucky to be able to work with Java, 
a language that we are familiar with through our coursework, however this came with its own challenges. The Android development community no 
longer focuses its efforts on Java, but rather Kotlin.

### 4.1 Dependency clashes

### 4.2 Poor Firebase documentation
We found the documentation for Firebase to be incredibly poor, lacking any mention of methods that are used in Firebase Firestore, 
Firebase Authentication or Firebase Storage. We found some useful functions in an *open-source GitHub repo* that showcased the various uses of Firebase.
We additionally had to read various *Firebase blogs*, written by the community, to find reference to different functionalities, such as callbacks.

### 4.3 Asynchronous data retrieval
One of the largest issues was creating database searching methods to be reused in our activities. This was done for separation of concerns 
but we later realised how essential it was since Firebase Firestore queries are asynchronous.

We had to create listener functions, using a *callback-based approach*. New listeners were created for different data types and use them to return 
the relevant data for use in other methods. This resulted in code being written using *lambda functions* for our callback, which was new for us.
