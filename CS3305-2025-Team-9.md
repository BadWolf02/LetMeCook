# LET ME COOK

<https://github.com/BadWolf02/LetMeCook>

## 1. Overview & Purpose

### 1.1 The Problem

We often find ourselves in silly situations at home or at the supermarket while grocery shopping -
forgetting what we already have, debating what to cook for the week, or leaving the shopping list at home.
More often than not, ingredients are forgotten in the back of the cupboard, only to be discovered long
past their expiry date. Meal planning on a budget can be a challenge, especially when trying to make
the most of what's already there, without wasting food or resorting to the same meals.

**Family organisation** can also be incredibly difficult. That thing you could've sworn was in the
cupboard earlier? Most likely used by your sibling while you were away. While you are solving this mystery,
your mother starts complaining that you did not magically read her mind and grabbed extra items from the store.
The ultimate challenge, however, is cooking a meal for the whole family. Finding one dish that pleases everyone
can be practically impossible.

These situations are all incredibly frustrating and very common, depending on your lifestyle.
They turn simple tasks into unnecessary challenges, making life harder than it needs to be.

There are existing applications that **partially** solve these issues. Some allow you to make shopping lists
or suggest recipes based on specific ingredients. Others function purely as digital cookbooks, offering
a wide variety of recipes but lacking interactive features.
Recipe websites can be quite inaccessible, cluttered with endless advertisements, requiring excessive
scrolling, demanding subscription after claiming to be free.

None of these solutions seem to have all the desired features in one simple and accessible application.

### 1.2 The Solution, Our App

Introducing our App: Let Me Cook. An app that allows you to browse recipes, track your household
inventory, add things to the household shopping list, and more.

We have a variety of smart features to help users plan their meal prep and shopping. We believe
our inventory system is easier to keep track of than a traditional inventory, as we have implemented
barcode scanning, saving time and hassle for adding items to the inventory. This makes it more
likely that users will keep the inventory up-to-date due to the ease of use.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 High Level View

![team9_letmecook-architecture.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_letmecook-architecture.jpg)

Figure 2.1: LetMeCook Architecture

Almost every feature of our app requires a persistent connection, or at least regular syncing with a
3rd party service.

#### 2.1.1 Firebase Firestore

Firebase Firestore (Firestore) is a **NoSQL document-based** database. It allows apps to store and sync data in
real time **asynchronously**. It offered the following additional benefits:

- Offline support. Data can be accessed and modified offline and synced when online.
- Google's security guarantees.
- Large number of reads and writes for free

We used Firestore to store the majority of our data, except for sensitive user data and images.
The following collections and fields were stored:

- Households
  - Household name
  - Inventory
  - Invited users
  - Members
  - Shopping list
- Ingredients
  - Name
  - ID
  - Allergens
  - Calories
  - Category
  - Serving size
- Recipes
  - Name
  - Author
  - Cuisine
  - Type
  - Allergens
  - Ingredients
  - Steps
  - Average rating
  - Reviews
- Users
  - Email
  - Username
  - Household Document ID
  - Invites
  - Favourite Recipes

#### 2.1.2 Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication is a service that provides secure user authentication for apps. It supports multiple
authentication methods and simplifies user management, handles **session persistence**, and integrates with
Firebase Firestore for user-based data security. It allows easy implementation of **password restrictions**
and allows disabling/deleting accounts from a console.

In our case, we used **email authentication and verification**. Our users could remain logged in after refreshing
the app or closing their phone. We stored the generated user ID from Authentication in Firestore as a
user's document ID to verify user details.

#### 2.1.3 Firebase Storage

Firebase Storage is a cloud service used for storing and fetching **user-generated files**, such as images,
videos, and documents. It allows:

- Scalable storage with Google Cloud infrastructure
- Secure file access using Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules
- Efficient uploads & downloads with automatic handling of network interruptions
- Direct URL sharing for accessing stored files

We used Firebase Storage to store images for recipes, which are uploaded when a user creates
a recipe or scrapes one from the web.

#### 2.1.4 ML Kit

Google's ML Kit is a great resource providing many libraries, including **Barcode Scanning**,
facial detection, text recognition, and object detection and tracking. This was one of the
better-documented technologies that we found with support for both Java and Kotlin. This is what
we used to handle scanning barcodes before sending the value to the OpenFoodFacts API.
This worked in conjunction with the CameraX module to live process barcode images inside our app
and on the device, requiring no network connection. It supports and automatically detects most
types of barcodes and QR codes once initialised and also supports any orientation of the barcode
when used with CameraX. This module calculates the rotation of the barcode for you. The ability to
**live process images** for barcodes and extract their data was instrumental in our app, and
Google's ML Kit made this a pleasure to implement.

#### 2.1.5 OpenFoodFacts

OpenFoodFacts is a **collaborative project** with contributors from all around the world.
The contributors are passionate individuals that choose to populate the database. **Anyone can
become a contributor** in mere minutes and help greatly with projects with a nature similar to
this one. They offer many different ways to access their data, including wrappers for most of the
major programming languages and a **web based JSON API**. This JSON API is what we ultimately
settled on using and it was instrumental in the ease of use of our app. This allows all the
important information regarding nutrition and allergens to be viewed almost instantly.
Their data is structured and stored well, so parsing the JSON data for this information was not
too much hassle either. Accessing and processing the information is almost instant, with
each barcode taking under 5 seconds to display the information, including the time taken for the
camera to focus on the barcode and the HTTP request to be sent.

#### 2.1.6 BBC Good Food

BBC Good Food is the United Kingdom's most popular food media brand with reach to millions of users.
Each recipe on their site is **thoroughly tested** by professional chefs so you can be sure to trust
every one on there. They also offer a wealth of information regarding health and nutrition, with all
of the nutrients listed in each recipe. These are only just some of the reasons we decided to go
with them when implementing "Trusted Web Scraped Recipes", as we wanted users to have access to
some of the best available. Accessing their information for web scraping was a pleasure using the
JSoup Java library and Gradle dependency, as each section for the recipe title, ingredients,
nutrients, and method could be taken using their respective CSS class selectors.
These recipes can also be saved to our Firebase database to be viewed later but are immediately
viewable inside the activity after entering and processing the URL.

#### 2.2.1 Activities and Fragments

An **Activity** is a single, standalone screen, hosting some UI components and managing a section of the app.
Data persists while the activity is running.
A **Fragment** is a component that lives inside an Activity and depends on its lifecycle.

When switching between different activities, intents are used in order to go from one activity
to another and pass relevant data.
This method is used to get from the sign up activity to the login activity on account creation
as shown in the below image.
It is used in a variety of other areas, such as the inventory in order to launch the **Barcode Scanning**
activity, in **Add Recipe** in order to handle uploading an image from the user's phone gallery,
when switching from the user fragment to viewing the invites. Recipe data is passed from the
**Home Fragment** to the **Recipe View Activity**.

![Image showing a picture of an intent taking the workflow from the signup to the login activity](report-imgs%2Fteam9_activities_flow_overview.png)

Figure 2.2.1 Activities and Intent flow Overview

We used Fragments for core navigation between our 5 primary pages via the navigation bar. These pages run
on the **MainActivity**. This ensured smooth navigation and that the main interactable pages would have
their data remain loaded. We used Activities to open smaller pages with a **shorter lifecycle**.

#### 2.2.2 Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Architecture

![team9_mvvm.png](report-imgs%2Fteam9_mvvm.png)

Figure 2.2.2: MVVM Architecture

MVVM is a software design pattern commonly used in Android development to separate concerns and improve
code organization. Its components include:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer
- **View**: Represents the UI layer
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the two layers.

We constantly aimed to adhere to this architecture, but found fragments to be difficult to work with so we
deviated in strictly using the ViewModel in some fragments.

![architectural overview diagram](report-imgs%2Fteam9_architecture_overview.png)

Figure 2.2.3 Architectural Overview

### 2.3 Dependencies & Other Resources

We made use of a variety of dependencies. Many of them were built into Android and Android Studio for
our development environment. Below are some keys resources that were used to aid in the development of
our app.

#### 2.3.1 Glide

Glide is an open-source image loading library for Android. It can load images from Firebase Storage
and efficiently caches images on retrieval.

#### 2.3.2 Google Fonts

Google provides a large variety of standardised images, symbols and logos for Android in XML format for download.
We made use of a wide variety of these throughout our app.

## 3. Main Components

The components will be broken down by page then by feature. We will highlight what happens when a
user interacts with something on screen.
We generally provide feedback to the user in the form of a Toast, which is an alert that appears with
some text. Otherwise the user will see visible change on their screen.

### 3.1 SearchDB

All methods used to retrieve data from our **Firestore database** were stored in the SearchDB class.
The class listeners for all relevant data types and search methods which callback to the listeners.
This file is imported in almost every other file to display data.

### 3.2 Sign Up

![team9_signup.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_signup.jpg)

Figure 3.1: Sign Up page screenshot

The Sign Up page allows users to enter a **unique** username, an email and a password which must
follow the displayed restrictions. The Login button redirects to the Login page. The Sign Up button
will then store the entered data and check if the details are valid.

### 3.2.1 Account Creation

When the user signs up, we first check if the fields are empty and then check if the username
exists already. If both of these pass, we pass this data to Firebase Authentication to create an account.

Firebase Authentication checks for a valid email and password restrictions. It also checks if the email
exists in our database. The account is created in Firebase Authentication with a user ID (UID) and their
password is **hashed**. The user is then sent a verification email.

Once the account is created in Firebase Authentication, we generate and store additional account details
in Firestore, as listed in the Firestore section. We generate a household ID and created a household
where the user is the only member.

### 3.2.2 Verification

![team9_verification.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_verification.jpg)

Figure 3.2: Verification email screenshot

In the user's inbox, they will receive the following email which redirects to a blank page saying
Verification Successful. Their account is now verified and is **eligible for login**.

### 3.3 Login

![team9_login.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_signup.jpg)

Figure 3.3: Login page screenshot

The user may enter an email and a password into the relevant fields and log in using the Login button.
The Sign Up button redirects to the Sign Up page.

When pressing the Login button. We first check if any of the fields are empty. Firebase Authentication
checks the email and password and checks if the email is verified. If this is successful, we create an
intent to move to the MainActivity. The UID is **persistently stored** so that it can be used to query the database. Multiple devices can be logged into a single account at once.

### 3.4 Home Page

![team9_homepage.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_homepage.jpg)

Figure 3.4: Home page screenshot

The home page is navigated to by the navbar and is a fragment on the MainActivity. It holds the
following features.

#### 3.4.1 Recipe List

This is a **RecyclerView** which contains an image and name of a recipe. A RecyclerView is a dynamic
list that can hold a specific xml file to create custom list items. This list by default will show
all results. If the list would go over 6 values, a Next Button appears, offering **pagination** so the
user can scroll. If there is no next page, the button disappears. A Previous Button will also appear
when scrolling, going back a page and disappearing if at the start of the list. When a list item is
pressed, it opens the RecipeViewActivity and passes over the recipe's ID.

#### 3.4.2 Recipe Filtering

There are 2 possible inputs for the user to filter in the two text boxes; **recipe name** and **author**.
The Search button will take the text in these inputs and pass them to a filterRecipe function. This
will display all results that match the combination of inputs. If there are no results, the **default
list** will appear. The **filterRecipe** function offers additional inputs which are not currently
implemented, such as searching by cuisine. If the user presses the Reset Button, the default list
will appear.

#### 3.4.3 What Can I Cook?

The What Can I Cook button functions similarly to the Recipe Filtering. Every recipe in the database is
looped through and their ingredients are stored. The user's household inventory is fetched and checked
for each recipe ingredient. If all ingredients are present in the inventory, the recipe is added to a
return list to be displayed. This is displayed in the Recipe List.

### 3.5 Recipe View

![team9_recipeview.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_recipeview.jpg)

Figure 3.5: Recipe View page screenshot. Details, favourite, add to shopping list

![team9_recipeview2.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_recipeview2.jpg)

Figure 3.6: Continuation of Recipe View page. Reviews.

This page is focused around the user interacting with a recipe they pressed in the Home page.

#### 3.5.1 Recipe Details

All data from the recipe is formatted and displayed to the user in a visually appealing and easy to
read way. This information is not interactable.

#### 3.5.2 Favourite Button

The Favourite Button is used to store a recipe in the user's favourite recipes which is displayed on
another page. It adds the recipe's ID to the user's Firestore document.

#### 3.5.3 Add to Shopping List Button

The Add to Shopping List Button fetches the recipe's ingredients, the user's household inventory and
the user's household shopping list. The ingredients list is looped through and if it is not present
in the inventory, it is stored in a return list. The return list is then looped through and checks
if any ingredient is in the shopping list. If it is, it is removed from the return list.
The list is then returned, where it contains all ingredients from the recipe that are not in the inventory or on the shopping list.

#### 3.5.4 Reviews

The user can add reviews by picking a **star rating** and writing text for the review. The Review button
submits the written review. The Reviews array in Firestore are then updated with the rating, the
comment and the username of the user. The recipe's average rating is then recalculated by checking all
current reviews, averaging them and rounding them to the nearest 0.5.

### 3.6 Chef's Corner (Recipe Creation)

Chef's corner is the feature that allows the user to custom create their own recipes.
The user is required to enter a recipe name, ingredients and steps needed to make the dish. When
adding the ingredients the user has autocomplete suggestions with the ingredients our database
contains, ensuring that all the ingredients added are real ingredients. The user is then prompted
to enter the amount and units of measurements of the ingredient they just entered. When adding the
steps necessary for recipe creation, the user is able to enter each new step into a separate field
which is dynamically created when the user chooses to add a new step. The user can also select a
meal type, a cuisine type and add the time it takes to cook the dish. Additionally the user can
also add a photo of the recipe which will be displayed when the recipe is displayed on the homepage.
When the user clicks the add recipe button the entered details are saved to google firestore
(and the image to google firebase). Below this, there is a button called "scrape recipes" that
brings the user to the WebScrapingActivity. At the top of this the user is prompted to enter a
URL for a BBC Good Food page. If the url they entered is a valid one, the recipe will be scraped
using the CSS selectors for the different sections (title, ingredients, method and nutrition).
The user can then see the title of the recipe they scraped under the url they entered and once
clicked, they can view the recipe details. The recipe is also saved to the Firebase in the same way
the user generated ones are.

### 3.7 Inventory Page

![team9_inventory.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_inventory.jpg)

Figure 3.9: Inventory page screenshot.

The Inventory Page is the page that holds the shared household inventory and where all inventory based operations take place.. This is an inventory shared between all members of a household and can be updated by any member who it belongs to.

#### 3.7.1 Ingredient List

![team9_ingredient-db-item.png](report-imgs%2Fteam9_ingredient-db-item.png)

Figure 3.10: Sample ingredient in Firestore database.

Each ingredient and all its details and values were derived from the United States Department of Agriculture Foodset Dataset. The ingredients were then cleaned of all unnecessary details and added into a 'master' dataset which was then iteratively added into the Firestore Database through a python script. Each ingredient is stored with its respective: allergens, calories per serving size, category (e.g. dairy, fats and oils, carbs, etc.), unique ID, name, and serving size.

#### 3.7.2 Adding and Removing of Ingredients

Ingredients can be added to the household inventory by clicking on the '+' icon in the inventory and then being able to select an item that is already stored in our database. The user will then be prompted to enter a quantity value for how much of an ingredient they are adding. The item will then be automatically added to the inventory.

Ingredients can be removed by clicking on the bin icon found in every ingredients' respective row to the right of the shopping cart icon. When this icon is pressed, the ingredient is removed from the household inventory in its entirety.

#### 3.7.3 Changing Quantity

Ingredient quantity can be changed to a value that the user wishes to change it to by manually clicking on the quantity and then updating its value. This change will reflect in the household inventory for all users and also in the database.

#### 3.7.4 Ingredient Search Bar

If the household inventory eventually becomes cluttered, there is a search bar found at the top of the page which will allow the user to search for any ingredient in their inventory, if it isn't found, then it isn't in the inventory.

#### 3.7.5 Live Ingredient Counter

A live ingredient counter can be found at the top of the page, this shows a live number of how many unique types of ingredients are currently in the household inventory.

#### 3.7.6 Add to Shopping List

Ingredients can be added to the users shopping list by clicking on the shopping cart icon which can be found in every ingredients' respective row. The icon is found to the left of the bin icon.

#### 3.7.7 Refresh Button

All inventory operations automatically refresh the inventory (except for the barcode scanner), so for any reason that an operation is completed and you don't notice an immediate updated inventory list, the refresh button can be clicked to receive an updated display from data retrieved from the database.

#### 3.7.8 Barcode Scanning

![team9_scanner.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_scanner.jpg)

Figure 3.11: Barcode scanning a pringles can.

Once the camera icon is clicked inside the inventory, the user is immediately brought to the CameraActivity.
The user sees their camera open in a window taking up around 2/3 of their screen. Under this they have 2 buttons:

- Take Photo
- Send to Inventory

They also see the prompt:
> "Scan food product barcode for nutritional information"

Once a barcode appears in the frame, the camera automatically detects it and processes what it sees.
To get the camera to work in the first place, we had to give it the appropriate camera permission in
the android manifest and used the **CameraX module** that by default calculates the rotation of
images automatically. Inside this module is **Google's ML Kit Barcode Scanning API** that takes
this rotation and the image processing each part of the barcode including what type of barcode it is.
This gives us the raw value of the barcode (5053990107353 in the case of the pringles can shown above).
Having received this value we send it to the OpenFoodFacts API using a **HTTP request** to interact
with their web based **JSON API**. To achieve this we used the OkHttp Java library and Gradle
dependency along with allowing the app internet permission in the android manifest. This gives us all
the details of the product in a JSON file that can be parsed, so we can access the data we want.
The section that previously said "Scan food product barcode for nutritional information" is now
updated with the following information:

- Product name
- Calories per 100g
- Allergy information

Pressing the take photo button sends whatever is inside the viewfinder to the user's gallery on
device (manifest permission to write to disk)and pressing the Send to Inventory button send the
product straight to the user's inventory fragment and updates their household.
The following information is passed:

- Product name
- Calories per 100g
- Allergy information
- Weight of the scanned product (so inventory displays the proper quantity)

Not only is the user's inventory updated but if the product is not already in our ingredients
database, it is added there too.

### 3.8 Shopping Page

![team9_shoppinglist.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_shoppinglist.jpg)

Figure 3.12: Shopping page screenshot

The shopping list page contains a text input, a dropdown select menu and a list of all shopping list
items along with a remove button. Items can be added by selecting from the database's list of
ingredients in the dropdown menu, or by custom writing an item in the text input. Items added to
the shopping list by the Add To Shopping List Button will be displayed here. Each item in the list
is displayed with a name and a button with an X which removes the item from the list when clicked.

### 3.9 User Page

![team9_userpage.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_userpage.jpg)

Figure 3.13: User page screenshot

The user page is the hub for all account management. It allows users to manage profile information,
edit some details, manage households, view invites or favourite recipes, and sign out.

#### 3.9.1 User Details

The user details section is contained in a profile box that dynamically displays account information
from Firebase such as username, email and household ID. This information is dynamically updated using
LiveData and ViewModel whenever changes are made.
The profile box is structured using a combination of ConstraintLayout, LinearLayout and CardView.

This section also displays user's profile picture. This profile picture is selected from a predefined
set of nine options stored as XML drawables. The selected profile picture is saved and displayed with
SharedPreferences, without the need of a reload. Edit profile and sign out buttons are contained in the
profile box.

#### 3.9.2 Edit Profile

![team9_edit-profile.png](report-imgs%2Fteam9_edit-profile.png)

Figure 3.14: Edit Profile page screenshot

The Edit Profile activity allows users to modify their display name, email and change profile picture
via a popup selection window. The activity is launched using Edit Profile button from the User Page.
Current profile picture is displayed at the top inside a CardView along with a change profile picture button.
The button opens a popup selection dialog. Username field in an EditText component is pre-populated with
existing name from the database. There is a "save-changes" button below that updates Firestore. This
activity follows MVVM architecture.

![team9_edit-pfp.png](report-imgs%2Fteam9_edit-pfp.png)

The popup profile selection dialog is built using an AlertDialog with GridLayout for neat display of
profile picture options. Clicking on a profile picture updated the selected state and provides instant
feedback, displaying the image on EditProfileActivity page. Once a user confirms their choice they must
click "Save button" on the selector dialog window to update all across the app outside of the EditProfileActivity.
No refresh is required. The popup window has a "cancel" button to not log changes.

#### 3.9.3 Sign Out Button

On pressing the Sign Out Button, the user is signed out using Firebase Authentication and an intent
directs them to the Login Activity.

### 3.10 Manage Household Page

![team9_managehousehold.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_managehousehold.jpg)

Figure 3.15: Manage Household page screenshot

The HouseholdManageActivity displays all info related to the user's household. From top to bottom in
the image above, it displays the household name, the household ID and the UID of each member of the
household.

The card below allows a user to invite another user to their household by inputting their username
and pressing Invite. This updates the invites array in the user's document in Firestore. Below the
Invite button displays all the pending invites for your Household.

### 3.11 View Invites page

![team9_invites.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_invites.jpg)

Figure 3.16: View Invites page screenshot

The ViewInvitesActivity displays all the invites that the user has received. Each invite is displayed
as an Accept Button, the household ID, and a Deny Button.

On pressing the Deny Button, the invite is removed from the user's invites array in Firestore and the
household's invited array. On pressing the Accept Button, the user joins the new household. This is done
by adding the user to the household's members array and removing them from the invited array, removing
the user from the old household's members array and removing the invite from the user's invites
array. If the old household is now empty, it is **deleted**.

### 3.12 Favourite Recipes

![team9_favourites.jpg](report-imgs%2Fteam9_favourites.jpg)

Figure 3.17: Favourite Recipes page screenshot

The Favourite Recipes page uses the same functionality as the Recipe List without pagination. It displays
all the user's favourited recipes, which can be pressed and bring the user to the RecipeViewActivity.

## 4 Challenges &  Lessons learned

We experienced a wide variety of challenges, largely caused by interacting with **new technologies**.
We havebeen lucky to be able to work with Java, a language that we are familiar with through our coursework, however this came with its own challenges. The Android development community no longer focuses its
efforts on Java, but rather Kotlin.

### 4.1 Dependency clashes

At the beginning of the development, we found a **Java wrapper** from OpenFoodFacts. This would allow for
**processing the barcode information in app**, instead of creating the HTTP request and relying on the
JSON API. When trying to import the dependency for this however, it introduced thousands of duplicate
dependency errors. The project would not build or run due to these and manually removing them proved
futile. Even when attempting to exclude the duplicate package from the import, the error for that
package and the rest persisted. We solved this by using the web based version which worked seamlessly.

### 4.2 Poor Firebase documentation

We found the documentation for Firebase to be incredibly poor, lacking any mention of methods that are
used in Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication or Firebase Storage. We found some useful functions
in an **open-source GitHub repo** that showcased the various uses of Firebase. We additionally had
to read various **Firebase blogs**, written by the community, to find reference to different
functionalities, such as callbacks.

### 4.3 Asynchronous data retrieval

One of the largest issues was creating database searching methods to be reused in our activities.
This was done for separation of concerns but we later realised how essential it was since
Firebase Firestore queries are asynchronous.

We had to create listener functions, using a **callback-based approach**. New listeners were created for
different data types and use them to return the relevant data for use in other methods.
This resulted in code being written using **lambda functions** for our callback, which was new for us.

### 4.4 Android Studio corrupting Gradle builds

Some of us ran into an issue where, on introducing a new dependency into the project, the project would
corrupt somehow. There were no resources online and ChatGPT and other AI assistants were not able
to identify any bugs in our Gradle files. We found that the only solution was to clone the repo again.

## 5 Contribution of Team members

Our group divided up tasks at each group meeting using a **Kanban board** on the website **Trello**. We filled
the Kanban board with tasks, noting importance as some tasks required others to be complete before beginning.
We commented on tasks with ideas and ways to expand and informed each other when we finished a task and
discussed which to take on next. This form of delegation worked incredibly well as we began development
with no group members having previous experience with app development.

### 5.1 Joseph 122320603

The main features I created, in approximate chronological order are:

- Sign Up. Account Creation & Verification
- Login
- Sign Out
- Manage Household
- View Invites
- Home Page. Recipe Filtering & Recipe List
- Recipe View.
- Favourites
- Shopping List
- Reviews on Recipes

I created various methods in SearchDB associated with other components throughout the process. I also
contributed to cleaning up the way our codebase is arranged, splitting database manipulating methods
into different classes associated with their individual use. I would frequently parse through the
codebase, looking for warnings given by Android Studio and fixing ones where they remained readable.

### 5.2 Nutsa

What I implemented:

- Designed the app logo and its drawable XML, implemented a launcher style
- Created a toolbar with a custom background
- Designed the navigation bar, sourced icons
- Designed User Fragment profile box
- Implemented the Edit Profile Activity
  - Updating Profile picture and name
  - Designed profile picture styles
- Added an inventory editing container with:
  - a search bar for searching ingredients in the inventory
  - camera button for implementing scanning
  - add button and a dialog box for manually adding ingredients
- Created an adapter for dynamically managing inventory items, added buttons for deleting items and adding to shopping cart.

### 5.3 Jack

What I contributed to the software project was:

- Suggested and created the Trello Kanban board
- Added methods into SearchDB for accessing and managing data in Firestore Database
- Found the starting dataset of food data from United States Department of Agriculture website
- Cleaned the 4GB dataset and various 10MB-30MB datasets and added them into a 'master' dataset that would suit our needs for the project
- Implemented and designed the ingredients architecture in the database
- Inventory management. Add/remove/change ingredient, search for ingredient, live ingredient counter, add ingredient to shopping list
- Solved the merge conflicts in the combination of the remote branches into a 'hell' branch before being pushed to origin/main
- Edited, put together, and voiced-over the 5 minute demo video

### 5.4 Morgan 122310136

The features that I implemented are:

- CameraX integration
- Barcode scanning
- Creating HTTP requests for API and web scraping
- Interaction with OpenFoodFacts API
- Parsing JSON data returned from OpenFoodFacts including product name, calories per 100g, allergy info and product weight
- Adding scanned ingredients to the user's inventory (and ingredient collection if it doesn't already exist there)
- Saving photos of food and ingredients to the device and Google Photos gallery
- Web scraping and displaying recipes including their nutritional and allergen information from BBC Good Food

As my camera and web scraping integrate into fragments that were managed by others, I made sure to communicate any and
all changes I made to their files, be it UI or functional. To make things run more efficiently, I put these features
in separate activities and passed the necessary information either to the database or back to the main activity.
I also made sure that any changes I made, did not revert the progress of anyone else working on that fragment.

### 5.5 Megan

- creating first architecture overview with Morgan on a whiteboard after discussing features with the entire group
- research about architecture of Apps
- Of the features listed in the Main Components I created:
  - recipes, deciding the format of recipes
      -> responsible for saving the recipe to Db, saving details set by recipes fragment to the firestore db with document based format,
  - adding custom recipes
    - adding recipe names, steps & dynamic creation of new step boxes as well as tracking to ensure proper saving, adding, selcetion of mealtypes, of cusine type, of time spent on dish.Selecting the image from the Galery, saving it to firestor and adding url to recips (figuring out how to allow selection of an image from the galery was done in pairprogramming with Morgan)
    - added a method to retrive allergen info and to retrive ingredients from our db in order to allow users to only select known ingredients
(I would also like to use this to point out that my group was extremly patient, when I was struggeling to understand how to properly access firebase and when I spend an entire week and barely managed to get any new features working due to just being up stuck on bugs and neede extra time on things that I thought I would get done in less time. They were all really patient and ended up taking on a few of the features I was originally going to do.)
